## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

- **UI**: 100% Kotlin with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for a declarative and modern UI.
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to ensure a clean separation of concerns.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) for managing background threads and asynchronous operations.
- **Database**: [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for robust and persistent local data storage.
- **Navigation**: [Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) for Compose to handle all in-app navigation.
- **Image Loading**: [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) for efficiently loading and displaying images.
- **Charting**: [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) for creating beautiful and interactive charts.
- **Data Export**: Utilizes [OpenCSV](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) and [iTextPDF](https://itextpdf.com/) for data export functionality.

## 🏛️ Architecture

This app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern. This design separates the UI from the business logic, making the code cleaner, easier to maintain, and more testable.
